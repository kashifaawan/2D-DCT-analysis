2D-DCT can be used to represent the image with few coefficients by transforming the value of pixels to the spatial frequencies.
In this project, the 2-D discrete cosine transform (DCT) of each 8x8 subblock is taken and then reconstructed image is obtained using variable number of coefficients in order to  determine a threshold for coefficients below which visual distortion is clearly visible.
